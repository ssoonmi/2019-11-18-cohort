# Write a method, filter_lengths(strings, length), that accepts an array of strings
# and a length as args. The method should return an array containing the strings
# that have at least the given length. The length argument should be optional; if no length
# is passed in, then 5 should be used as the length.

def filter_lengths(strings, length=5) # default value of 5 if no length is given
    # strings = ["cat", "dog", "capybara", "mouse"]
    # length = 5
    strings.select { |str| str.length >= length } # selecting only the string that meets the conditional
    # ["capybara", "mouse"]
end
